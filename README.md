# SOC Fundamentals and Incident Response Lab

This repository is part of the **HackerHub8 Internship Program**.
The project provides hands-on exposure to fundamental Security
Operations Center (SOC) concepts using a controlled virtual
lab environment.

---

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to understand how SOC analysts
monitor systems, analyze system behavior, and identify potential
security incidents. The work focuses on Linux system observation,
network activity analysis, service enumeration, and basic incident
awareness.

A safe and isolated virtual lab environment is used to perform
practical security analysis and document observations through
hands-on exercises.
