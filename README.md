Day 1 – Environment Setup
On Day 1, I created the GitHub repository and set up the lab environment.
I installed Oracle VirtualBox and Kali Linux and verified that the Kali Linux virtual machine runs successfully.
This setup is used for practicing basic SOC and cybersecurity concepts.


Day 2 – Linux Basics
On Day 2, I practiced basic Linux terminal commands in Kali Linux.
I explored directory navigation, checked system information, and updated the system.
Screenshots of command execution are added in the Screenshots folder as proof of work.
