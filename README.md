# SOC Fundamentals and Incident Response Lab

This repository is part of the **HackerHub8 Internship Program**.
The project aims to provide practical exposure to fundamental
Security Operations Center (SOC) concepts through a controlled
virtual lab environment.

---

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to understand how SOC analysts
monitor systems, analyze logs, and identify potential security
incidents. The work focuses on Linux system behavior, network
monitoring, authentication logs, and basic incident awareness.

A safe and isolated virtual lab is used to observe security-related
activities and document findings through hands-on practice.

## Tools & Environment
- Oracle VirtualBox  
- Kali Linux  
- Metasploitable 2  
- Host Operating System: Windows  

---

## Key Activities Performed
- Set up and configured a virtual lab environment
- Practiced Linux system and network commands
- Monitored running processes and system resources
- Analyzed authentication and system log files
- Observed login activity and identified suspicious behavior
- Introduced a deliberately vulnerable system (Metasploitable) for security learning

---

## Learning Outcomes
- Gained hands-on experience with Linux system monitoring
- Understood basic SOC operations and incident detection
- Learned the importance of logs in identifying security events
- Developed awareness of secure and insecure system configurations
- Improved technical documentation and version control practices using GitHub

### Metasploitable2 Setup

Metasploitable2 vulnerable virtual machine was successfully configured in VirtualBox.  
Boot issues were resolved by attaching the correct virtual disk, and the system was started successfully.  
Login access was verified using default credentials, confirming the target machine is ready for vulnerability testing.
