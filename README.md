## Day 1 – Environment Setup
On Day 1, I set up the lab environment required for the SOC project.

# Tasks Completed
- Created the GitHub repository  
- Installed Oracle VirtualBox  
- Installed Kali Linux virtual machine  
- Verified that Kali Linux boots and runs successfully  
This environment will be used for all further SOC practice.

## Day 2 – Linux Basics
On Day 2, I practiced basic Linux commands to understand system navigation and information.

### Commands Practiced
- `pwd` – Checked current directory  
- `ls` – Listed files and folders  
- `cd` – Navigated between directories  
- `uname -a` – Viewed system information  
- `whoami` – Checked logged-in user  
- `sudo apt update` – Updated system packages  

## Day 3 – Network & System Commands
On Day 3, I executed basic system and network monitoring commands in Kali Linux.

### Network Commands
- `ip a` – Checked network interfaces and IP address  
- `ip route` – Viewed routing table  
- `ping 8.8.8.8` – Tested internet connectivity  
- `ss -tuln` – Viewed active listening ports  

### System Commands
- `uptime` – Checked system running time  
- `hostname` – Viewed system hostname  
- `df -h` – Checked disk usage  

Screenshots for these commands are uploaded in the **Screenshots** folder as proof of execution.
