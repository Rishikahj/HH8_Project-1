Day 1 – Environment Setup
On Day 1, I created the GitHub repository and set up the lab environment.
I installed Oracle VirtualBox and Kali Linux and verified that the Kali Linux virtual machine runs successfully.
This setup is used for practicing basic SOC and cybersecurity concepts.


Day 2 – Linux Basics
On Day 2, I practiced basic Linux terminal commands in Kali Linux.
I explored directory navigation, checked system information, and updated the system.
Screenshots of command execution are added in the Screenshots folder as proof of work.

Day 3 – Network and System Commands
On Day 3, I executed basic network and system monitoring commands in Kali Linux to understand system status and network information.

Commands Executed:-

*Network Commands*
-ip a – Checked network interfaces and IP address
-ip route – Viewed routing and default gateway
-ping 8.8.8.8 – Tested network connectivity
-ss -tuln – Viewed listening ports and active services

*System Commands*
-uptime – Checked system running time and load
-whoami – Verified current logged-in user
-hostname – Checked system hostname
-df -h – Viewed disk usage

Screenshots of these command executions are uploaded in the Screenshots folder.
